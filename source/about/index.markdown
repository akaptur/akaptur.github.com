I live in Brooklyn and work for [Hacker School](//www.hackerschool.com).  If you like this blog, you'll probably like Hacker School!

I write mostly Python, and I love silly hacks. I've given some [talks](/talks) about Python internals. Python internals are very cool.

Before Hacker School, I studied Astronomy & Physics at Yale.  I did a research project on [blazars](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazar), a type of supermassive black hole, and was a co-author on a [paper](//arxiv.org/abs/0812.4582) about our data. I worked in finance for a few years before I became a programmer.

You can find me on [github](//www.github.com/akaptur) and [twitter](//www.twitter.com/akaptur).
