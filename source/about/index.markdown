I'm a software engineer based in San Francisco. I write mostly Python, and I love silly hacks. I've given some [talks](/talks) about Python internals.

I work for a small startup that's working to automate bookkeeping for businesses. I've previously worked at Dropbox and the [Recurse Center](//www.recurse.com), an educational retreat for programmers in NYC. If you like this blog, you'll probably like the Recurse Center.

Before I was a software engineer, I studied Astronomy & Physics at Yale.  I did a research project on [blazars](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazar), a type of supermassive black hole, and was a co-author on a [paper](//arxiv.org/abs/0812.4582) about our data. I also worked for a financial research firm for several years as an equity research analyst.

You can find me on [github](//www.github.com/akaptur) and [twitter](//www.twitter.com/akaptur).
