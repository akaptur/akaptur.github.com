## Import-ant decisions
I gave a talk about how `import` works at [PyCon 2014](https://us.pycon.org/2014/).  There's video [here](http://pyvideo.org/video/2567/import-ant-decisions), and the slides are [here](https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2014/import-ant-decisions-by-allison-kaptur).

## A 1,500 (!!) line swith statement powers your Python!
I gave a talk about the Python interpreter at [!!Con 2014](//bangbangcon.com). !!Con was a new conference in 2014 celebrating excitement and wonderful things about programming. All talks had at least one exclamation point in the title. The slides from my talk are [here](http://www.slideshare.net/akaptur/a-1500-line-switch-statement-powers-your-python-allison-kaptur-con-2014), video is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4s9MkZATWY4) and a transcript is [here](http://bangbangcon.com/2014-transcripts/allison-kaptur-switch-statement-1500-lines.txt). The background of those slides is the switch statement itself.
