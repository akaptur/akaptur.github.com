## Limitless and Recursion-free Recursion Limits!! (!!con 2015)
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk1I6ZxcceU)

This might be the most fun I've had giving a talk - how to implement tail-call optimization in Python by hacking bytecode.

## Import-ant decisions (PyCon 2014)
A talk about how `import` works in Python, imagining inventing it from scratch. (Tip from experience: while having a pun in your talk title is a great idea, making the talk title impossible to pronounce is not.)

## A 1,500 (!!) line swith statement powers your Python! (!!con 2014)
A talk about the Python interpreter at [!!Con 2014](//bangbangcon.com). !!Con was a new conference in 2014 celebrating excitement and wonderful things about programming. All talks had at least one exclamation point in the title. The slides from my talk are [here](http://www.slideshare.net/akaptur/a-1500-line-switch-statement-powers-your-python-allison-kaptur-con-2014), video is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4s9MkZATWY4) and a transcript is [here](http://bangbangcon.com/2014-transcripts/allison-kaptur-switch-statement-1500-lines.txt). The background of those slides is the switch statement itself.
